# DS3DeathCounter
Ever wish DS3 displayed how many times you died? Well, now you can get that number.

Other death counters seemed to have broken with FromSoftware bringing the servers back. This one works. For now.

Can be added as a source in OBS or used just for general curiosity I guess.

# Usage
Running the script will read from the currently running DS3 process and write to a file named `DS3Deaths.txt`

You need an x64 install of Python in order to run this project. I will work on an executable file at some point (when I'm not being lazy).

# Contributing
Feel free to open an issue / branch off of this project. You can also reach out to me over email at milkietoast@gmail.com if I seem to be absent.

Due to the simple nature of this, I don't anticipate there will need to be a lot of changes unless FromSoftware decides to update addresses again, but any help is appreciated.
